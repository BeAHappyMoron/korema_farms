🌱 Hydroponic Cucumber 3D

Welcome to the Hydroponic Cucumber 3D project! 🥒🚀 Where nature meets groundbreaking technology—or at least, some React, Three.js, and a whole lot of debugging.
<br><br>
🚀 Technologies Used
<br>
This project is powered by:

React.js ⚛️ - Because why not complicate everything with a virtual DOM?

Three.js 🎮 - For rendering that fancy cucumber in all its 3D glory.

Tailwind CSS & Vanilla CSS 🎨 - A mix of utility-first speed and old-school styling struggles.

WebStorm 💡 - The IDE of choice because sometimes, VS Code just doesn’t cut it (or because we love built-in refactoring).
<br><br>

🎯 Project Goals
<br><br>

🥒 Display a realistic 3D cucumber grown through the magic of hydroponics.<br>
💡 Implement an interactive "View Stats" button that blurs the background and educates users on the perks of hydroponic farming.<br>
🖱️ Enable smooth mouse controls for rotation (because why would anyone NOT want to spin a cucumber?).<br>
✨ Make it look aesthetic and futuristic, because hydroponics is the future.<br>
<br><br>

📌 Current Progress

<br>
✅ Cucumber model is loaded (and looking delicious).<br>
✅ Scene lighting is set up to make the cucumber shine.<br>
✅ Basic UI elements are in place.<br>
🛠️ Working on making the stats section sleek and smooth.<br>
🔜 Future: Maybe add water droplets? A bite animation? Who knows!<br>
<br><br>
🥒 Fun Fact
<br>
Did you know that hydroponic cucumbers use 50% less water than traditional soil-grown cucumbers? Now you do! 🎓
